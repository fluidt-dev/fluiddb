# IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE FLUIDDB GITHUB ISSUES

Github issues SHOULD ONLY BE USED to report bugs, and for DETAILED feature
requests.
  
PLEASE DO NOT POST GENERAL QUESTIONS that are not about bugs or suspected
bugs in the Github issues system.
  
# Reporting Security Bugs

*If you are reporting a security bug*, please contact the core team privately
by emailing fluiddb@fluidt.dev. Your report will be acknowledged by a core team
member and once the report has been reviewed you will receive a more detailed
response including next steps.

# How to contribute

1. Find a Bug or fill out a detailed feature request.
    1. Fork Fluiddb on github ( http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ )  
    1. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)
    1. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)
    1. Initiate a pull request on github ( https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/ )
    1. Done :)
1. Keep in mind that we are very overloaded, so issues and PRs sometimes wait
for a *very* long time. However this is not lack of interest, as the project
gets more and more users, we find ourselves in a constant need to prioritize
certain issues/PRs over others. If you think your issue/PR is very important
try to popularize it, have other users commenting and sharing their point of
view and so forth. This helps.
1. For minor fixes just open a pull request on Github.
